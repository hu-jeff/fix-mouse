I couldn't find an app that took care of all the changes I needed to use my mouse so, I made one.
- Reverse the scrolling of the mouse so the trackpad can have natural scrolling without the mouse being affected
- Prevent CTRL+Left-Click becoming Right-Click
- Increase the scroll speed of only the mouse
- Stop SHIFT+scroll from becoming a horizontal scroll
